# Mini Project 1: Training and Assessing ML Models

Welcome to the repository for Mini Project 1. This project is centered on the training and assessment of various machine learning classifiers and regression models using both synthetic and real-world datasets. It includes three primary tasks, each addressing different machine learning methodologies.

## Project Synopsis

### Task Breakdown

#### Task 1: Linear Classifier
- **Goal:** Train and assess a linear classifier on a synthetic dataset.
- **Details:**
  - Created a synthetic dataset with 3 features and 4 classes utilizing `sklearn.datasets`.
  - Implemented a linear classifier with different hyperparameter configurations.
  - Visualized decision boundaries and classification results.

#### Task 2: Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) on CWRU Bearing Dataset
- **Goal:** Conduct feature extraction and train MLP models on the extended CWRU Bearing dataset.
- **Details:**
  - Augmented the CWRU Bearing dataset by adding more fault categories.
  - Performed feature extraction and data preparation.
  - Trained and evaluated MLP models with various architectures.
  - Applied K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation techniques.

#### Task 3: Regression Analysis on Weather Dataset
- **Goal:** Execute regression analysis using multiple methodologies.
- **Details:**
  - Investigated the relationship between temperature and humidity in the Weather in Szeged dataset.
  - Applied LS, RLS, and WLS methodologies to predict temperature.
  - Compared the performance of different regression models.

## Data Details

### Synthetic Classification Dataset
- **Details:** A synthetic dataset generated using `sklearn.datasets` for binary and multi-class classification tasks.

### CWRU Bearing Dataset
- **Details:** Vibration data collected from a motor under various fault conditions and speeds, used for bearing fault diagnosis.

### Weather Dataset
- **Details:** Weather data accumulated over 10 years, providing attributes related to temperature, humidity, and other conditions, used for regression tasks.
